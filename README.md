This app allows you to record moments in your life that instill a sense of gratitude. The goal is that by
regularly posting things you are grateful for, your overall sense of gratitude is increased. This app contains
several different views to help you track how often you post and gain a sense of any trends over time.

This app was made using React, Javascript and D3 for the front-end and Rails for the back-end.
